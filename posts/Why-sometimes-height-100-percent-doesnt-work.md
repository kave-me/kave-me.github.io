`height` and `with` are two of the most important styling tags in CSS, have it occurred to you try to use `height: 100%;` on a tag, for example a `div` tag, and you see no change as the result of `height: 100%` but something like `height: 200px` works perfectly fine?


It happened a few time for me, at that point of time I didn't know by default the values of `heigth` is `auto` by default, which in most cases means stretch to fit the content, by the way if you are using a **percent** unit take a look at the parent element.

a shorthand solution for some small projects of mine is to do the following at the top of your CSS.
```css
html,
body {
    height: 100%;
}
```
If you are asking yourself what is the parent of `html` tag as I asked myself a few times, the right answer might be it depends on `Window` object, so let's read more about it on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window "MDN Web Docs")  ðŸ˜‰.
